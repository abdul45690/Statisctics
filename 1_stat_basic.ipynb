    "1. **Descriptive Statistics** - This type involves describing, showing or summarizing data in a meaningful way. For example, using mean or standard deviation to summarize test scores of a class. \n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics** - This type involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data taken from the population. For example, making predictions about election results based on pre-election polls."

    "2. **Quantitative Data (Numerical)** - This data type consists of numbers and can be divided into discrete and continuous data. For example, age, height, temperature."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Levels of measurement indicate how a variable is quantitatively measured. There are four levels:\n",
    "1. **Nominal**: Classification without a natural order. Example: Types of fruits.\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**: Classification with a natural order but without a fixed interval. Example: Ratings (good, better, best).\n",
    "3. **Interval**: Measurements with equal intervals but no true zero. Example: Temperature in Celsius.\n",
    "4. **Ratio**: Measurements with a true zero. Example: Weight."

For example, summarizing annual sales data (descriptive) and predicting future sales based on past trends (inferential)."

They help in describing the distribution and spread of data. For example, mean and standard deviation can describe the average and variability of test scores in a class."
